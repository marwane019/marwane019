# Hi, I'm Marwane Bakkali Hassani 👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate based in London with a passion for turning data into insights and shipping clean code. I build end‑to‑end solutions that start with messy CSV/JSON and end with tidy datasets, interactive dashboards, and clear summaries. My toolkit includes Python, SQL, pandas, ETL pipelines, Chart.js, Git/GitHub, and solid data structures & algorithms fundamentals.

## 📂 Featured Projects

- **[data‑analysis‑portfolio](https://github.com/marwane019/data-analysis-portfolio)** – A fully interactive data analysis portfolio showcasing a synthetic mobility dataset with daily and weekly trends. Built with Python for data generation and Chart.js for the front‑end, it includes an interactive line chart, bar chart, downloadable data/README, and a polished GitHub Pages site. [View it live](https://marwane019.github.io/data-analysis-portfolio/).

- **[Titanic‑Survival‑Prediction](https://github.com/marwane019/Titanic-Survival-Prediction)** – A classic machine learning project predicting passenger survival using logistic regression and feature engineering.

- **[GravitySim](https://github.com/marwane019/GravitySim)** – A simple gravity simulator built with Python and Pygame, modelling bodies under Newtonian gravitation.

- **[CMB‑Spectrum‑Model](https://github.com/marwane019/CMB-Spectrum-Model)** – A computational astrophysics project modelling the cosmic microwave background power spectrum.
